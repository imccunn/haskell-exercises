-- making typeclasses and creating type instances by hand

-- typeclasses are like interfaces

-- defines some behavior and then types that can behave in that way
-- are made instances of that typeclass

-- the bahavior of typeclasses is acheived by defining functions or just type
-- declarations that we then implement.
-- type is an instance of a typeclass - we can use the functions that the typeclass defines with that type.

-- See Eq typeclass that defines function == and /=
